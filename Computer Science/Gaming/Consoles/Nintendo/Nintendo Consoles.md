The Japanese company [[Nintendo]] has made a total of seven home video game consoles and multiple portable ones, also dedicated consoles and hardware like gamepads for their consoles.

The first ever console was the [[Color TV-Game]], but was just released in Japan. The first worldwide successes were Game & Watch handheld series, later getting better success with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] or the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], originally released as the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan in 1983. It restarted the video game industry after the [[videogame crash of 1983]]. In 1989, [[Nintendo]] released [[GameBoy]], the first handheld to sell in large numbers. When in the 1990s, their market began to dip, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] or the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] became a strong 1990 seller. In the end of 1990s, [[Sony|Sony's]] [[PlayStation]] became the most popular console, beating the [[N64]].

The [[Dreamcast]], released in 1998, [[PlayStation 2]], released in 2000, and Microsoft's [[Xbox]], released in 2001, would eventually relegate [[Nintendo]] to third place in the international market, despite the release of the [[GameCube]]. However, they retained their lead in the handheld console market, with the [[Game Boy Color]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] models. Towards the middle of the 2000s, Nintendo introduced the first successful handheld device with a touch screen ([[DS]]) and the first successful console designed for motion controlled inputs (the [[Wii]]); they became some of the best-selling consoles of all time. In 2011, [[Nintendo]] became the first major company to release a handheld game console with [[stereoscopic 3D capabilities]], with the [[3DS]], which had very strong sales from the beginning. The [[Wii U]] released in November 2012, was much less successful, and sales were significantly lower than predicted. The company's most recent console, [[Nintendo Switch]], was released in March 2017 and has now surpassed the entire lifetime sales of the [[Wii U]] several times.
