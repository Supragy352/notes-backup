# Introduction

## PlatformIO Core (CLI)

**PlatformIO Core** (CLI tool) is the heart of the entire PlatformIO ecosystem and consists of

* Multi-platform Build System
* Unified Package Manager
* Library Management [^1]
* Library Dependency Finder (LDF) [^2]
* Serial Port Monitor
* Integration Components (Cloud and Desktop [[integrated development environment|IDEs]] and  Continuous Integration).

**PlatformIO Core** is written in [[Computer Science/Languages/Python]][^3] and works on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]] and [[ARM]] - based credit-card sized
computers:
	- [[Raspberry Pi]]
	- [[BeagleBone]]
	- [[CubieBoard]]
	- [[Samsung]] [[ARTIK]]


**PlatformIO Core** provides a rich and documented Command Line Interface (CLI).
The other PlatformIO-based software and IDEs are based on **PlatformIO Core CLI**,
such as  `pioide`. In other words, they wrap **PlatformIO Core** with own GUI.
