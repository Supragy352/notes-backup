# Torrents
Internet Protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing made by Bram Cohen, a CS Grad from University of Buffalo. 

## Method
- When a file is turned to a torrent, it gets broken into thousands of little pieces. And the torrent file tells the app where to look for it. 
- Might be on multiple computers, called "seeds". Downloader is called a "peer".
- Once its all there you start sharing it again.
- There is a tracking server with a "map" of each snippet of the file.
