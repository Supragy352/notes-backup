**Git** is a [distributed version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control "Distributed version control") system that tracks changes in any set of [computer files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file "Computer file"), usually used for coordinating work among [programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer "Programmer") collaboratively developing [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") during [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development"). Its goals include speed, [data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity "Data integrity"), and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

Git was originally authored by [[Linus Torvalds]] in 2005 for development of the [[Linux|Linux kernel]], with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other [[distributed version control]]systems, and unlike most [[client–server]] systems, every Git [[directory]] on every [[computer]] is a full-fledged [repository]] with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is [[free and open-source software]] distributed under the [[Licensing|GPL-2.0-only]] license.
