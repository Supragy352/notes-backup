# Introduction
**R** is a [[programming language]] for [[Statistical Computing]] and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. Created by statisticians [Ross Ihaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka "Ross Ihaka") and [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician) "Robert Gentleman (statistician)"), R is used among [data miners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining "Data mining"), [bioinformaticians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics "Bioinformatics") and [statisticians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistician "Statistician") for [[data analysis]] and developing [statistical software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_software "Statistical software").Users have created packages to augment the functions of the R language.

According to user surveys and studies of scholarly literature databases, R is one of the most commonly used programming languages used in data mining. As of March 2022, R ranks 11th in the [TIOBE index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index "TIOBE index"), a measure of programming language popularity, in which the language peaked in 8th place in August 2020.

The official R software environment is an [[Open-Source|open-source]] free software environment within the [GNU package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_packages "List of GNU packages"), available under the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License "GNU General Public License"). It is written primarily in [[C]], [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran "Fortran"), and R itself (partially self-hosting). Precompiled [[Executable|executables]] are provided for various [[Operating Systems]]. R has a [[Command Line Interface|CLI]]. Multiple third-party [[graphical user interfaces|GUIs]] are also available, such as [RStudio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio "RStudio"), an [[integrated development environment|IDE]], and [Jupyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupyter "Jupyter"), a [notebook interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface "Notebook interface").

R is a programming language created by statisticians for statistics, specifically for working with data. It is a language for computing and visualising data.

## What makes R unique?
R is unique as it is **not** general purpose. As it does not do a lot of gibberish, it does what it does best. While other languages might have libraries for data analysis and viz, R has most of its functionalities built in to its core.

## What is R used for?
Academics, scientists, and researchers use it to analyze the results of experiments. In addition, businesses of all sizes and in every industry use it to extract insights from the increasing amount of daily data they generate.

### Fintech
Fintech companies[^1] use R to create credit risk models and other types of risk analysis. It is also used for fraud detection, mortgage modeling, volatility modeling, client assessment, and loan stress test simulations.

### Research
R is widely used in academics and research. For example Cornell University teaches R in courses that require statistical computing.

### Retail
In retail, R is used for risk analysis and marketing strategies. R's machine learning capabilities are used to improve cross-selling and suggest better-related products at checkout to increase profits and sales.

### Government
The National Weather Service uses R to predict weather conditions. FDA uses R to evaluate drugs, perform pre-clinical tasks and predict possible reactions.

### Data Journalism
Data journalists use data to tell a story. They are journalists and data scientists who pull insights about our world and how we live from public data. R is a popular language for data journalists because it gives them the ability to find these insights and generate stunning graphics that tell the story.

### Social Media
The R programming language is used for social media analytics, segmenting potential customers, and targeting ads.

### Healthcare
R is heavily used in genetics, bioinformatics, drug discovery, and epidemiology. Crunching numbers in pre-clinical tasks
