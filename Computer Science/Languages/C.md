# Introduction
**C** is a [general-purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_language "General-purpose language") computer [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language"). It was created in the 1970s by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie "Dennis Ritchie"), and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"), [device drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_drivers "Device drivers"), [protocol stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_stack "Protocol stack"), though decreasingly for [application software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software"). C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest [supercomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer") to the smallest [microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller "Microcontroller") and [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system "Embedded system").

A successor to the programming language [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language) "B (programming language)"), C was originally developed at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs "Bell Labs") by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie "Dennis Ritchie") between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix"). It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the [most widely used programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_programming_language_popularity "Measuring programming language popularity") with C [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") available for almost all modern [computer architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture "Computer architecture") and [[Operating Systems]]. C has been standardized by [ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute "American National Standards Institute") since 1989 ([ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C "ANSI C")) and by the [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization "International Organization for Standardization") (ISO).

C is an [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming "Imperative programming") [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming "Procedural programming") language supporting [structured programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming "Structured programming"), [lexical variable scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_variable_scope "Lexical variable scope"), and [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science) "Recursion (computer science)"), with a [static type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_type_system "Static type system"). It was designed to be [compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") to provide [low-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language "Low-level programming language") access to [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory "Computer memory") and language constructs that map efficiently to [machine instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code "Machine code"), all with minimal [runtime support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system). Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard) "Specification (technical standard)")-compliant C program written with [portability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_portability "Software portability") in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#cite_note-cppreference-10)

Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two languages in the [TIOBE index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index "TIOBE index"), a measure of the popularity of programming languages.
