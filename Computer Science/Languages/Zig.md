Zig is a programming language designed to be simple, efficient, and reliable. It was created by Andrew Kelley with the goal of providing a better alternative to [[C]] while retaining the same level of performance and control.

One of the main features of Zig is its focus on safety and correctness. It provides compile-time and runtime checks to help prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows. Additionally, Zig has a strong emphasis on memory management and provides automatic [[Memory Management|memory allocation and deallocation]].

Another key aspect of Zig is its simplicity. The language is designed to be easy to learn and use, with a clear and concise syntax that is similar to C. Zig also includes a powerful build system that makes it easy to create, test, and distribute projects.

Overall, Zig is a modern [[programming language]] that combines the performance and control of [[C]] with the safety and simplicity of modern languages. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, Zig is a great choice for developing fast, reliable, and secure software.
