# Welcome
There are **7 Deadly Sins in Programming**.

# Not Using Programming Standard

- Stuff like decided line spacing, indents.
- Can just pick one up

# Principles
![[Pasted image 20230524201929.png]]

- Principles are like a general guide.
- **SOLID** The 5 Important ones:
![[Pasted image 20230524203113.png]]
	1. **Single Responsibility**: Breaking down code into small modules of one responsibility each.
	2. **Open/Closed**: Design the modules to be able to add new functionality without changing them.
	3. **Liskov Substitution**: Only extend modules if we are sure that its the same at heart. No overhangs.
	4. **Interface Segregation**: Modules shouldn't know about stuff they dont use
	5. **Dependency Inversion**: Develope own communication interfaces
All these principles make our code:

# Patterns
Solutions to our problems

1. **Creational Patterns**: Concerned with creating instances.![[Pasted image 20230524204808.png]]
2. **Structural Patterns**: Concerned with organisation of objects![[Pasted image 20230524204812.png]]
3. **Behavioural Patterns**: Focus on how code functions![[Pasted image 20230524204837.png]]

# Adequate Naming

## Before

## After

### Be Descriptive

# Testing Code
![[Pasted image 20230524205151.png]]

# Time
![[Pasted image 20230524205259.png]]

 - You should have a realistic time barrier

# Speed
