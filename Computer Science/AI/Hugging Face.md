Hugging Face, Inc. is an American company that develops tools for building applications using [[machine learning]]. It is most notable for its [[transformers]] library built for [[natural language processing]] applications and its platform that allows users to share [[machine learning]] [[models]] and [[datasets]].

# What's the Hugging Face Hub?

We are helping the community work together towards the goal of advancing Machine Learning 🔥.

The Hugging Face Hub is a platform with over 120k models, 20k datasets, and 50k demos in which people can easily collaborate in their ML workflows. The Hub works as a central place where anyone can share, explore, discover, and experiment with open-source Machine Learning.

No single company, including the Tech Titans, will be able to “solve AI” by themselves – the only way we’ll achieve this is by sharing knowledge and resources in a community-centric approach. We are building the largest open-source collection of models, datasets, demos and metrics on the Hugging Face Hub to democratize and advance ML for everyone 🚀.

# What's on the Hub?

-   Models, _hosting the latest state-of-the-art models for NLP, vision, and audio tasks_
-   Datasets, _featuring a wide variety of data for different domains and modalities_..
-   Spaces, _interactive apps for demonstrating ML models directly in your browser_.

## Models

Models can be shared and open-sourced by the community. Each one working on their own, and showing it to others, Kinda like the GitHub for AI models. The limitations are shown using [[Model Cards]]. Metadata can also be included to provide info about them. [[TensorBoard traces]] are also supported. An [inference widget](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-widgets) is supported to work on the model right in the browser. And [[Application Programming Interface|API]] is also provided for [[File Serving|serving]] the model.

## Databases

- [The Hub] is home to over 5,000 [[Dataset|datasets]] in more than 100 languages that can be use for a variety of tasks across [[NLP]], [[Computer Vision]] and Audio. 
- They have documentation in the forms of [[Dataset Cards]] and [[Dataset Previews|Previews]].
- The [🤗 `datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) library allows programmatic interaction with the datasets, allowing to easily use datasets from the Hub in projects.
- Dataset streaming is possible to conserve space.

## Spaces

Sort of like a toolkit to use [[Computer Science/Languages/Python]] [[SDK|SDKs]] (**[Gradio](https://gradio.app/)** and **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**) and build deployable apps for the Hub.  Can also run on a GPU or [[Hardware Acceleration|accelerated hardware]].
