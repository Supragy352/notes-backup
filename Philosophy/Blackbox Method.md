## Blackbox description / examples
Its a piece of code that does something, but we don't need to know HOW it does it is what a blackbox means.
For Example:  
	- Sorting is one place where a blackox is described as a general method is used to sort an array using a library one like `a.sort()` in [[Python]] or `sort(a.begine(), a.end())` in [[C++]]. 
	- [[Fenwick Tree | Fenwick/Binary Indexed Trees]] are an example of blackbox where the description is:
		- Operates on an array
		- Utility : Supports 2 operations
			1) add( i, x): adds x to the value at index i.
			2) query(i): Returns the sum of the first i elements.
		- There is a bitwise logic that makes it work but we don't need to know that.
