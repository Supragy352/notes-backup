## 1. Variables
A [[Variables|variable]] is a name to which a data can be assigned. The values stored can be updated. While creating a variable we specify its type.
Eg: int, float, bool, string etc.

```cs
int playerPosition = 1;
float playerHealth = 15f;
```

## 2.Methods
A [[Method]] is a name under which a set of instructions lie and can be executed by calling the name. It is a means of isolating a piece of code. A method can use passed variables at the time of calling the method to use during its execution. A method can also return data as return statements. The type of data to be retuned should be declared while creating the function.

Eg: Creating random names
```cs
	string generateRandomName() {
	string randomName="";
	return randomName;
}

string name = generateRandomName();
```
