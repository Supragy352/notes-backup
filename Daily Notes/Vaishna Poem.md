I am so haunted by the ghosts of my past
Sabotaging everything I have so it never lasts
Letting my fears get the better of me
Shackled my bonds so that I can't break free
I say I'm stone but I feel more than I should
I would really turn off the switch if I could

Pushing people away, never letting them close
Then feeling my heart ache cause I feel more alone than most
Loving them from a distance and loving them with all my heart
But I know how to leave them before they leave me like an artist knows his art
Built these walls around me because I thought they'd protect me
But the walls are flooded with my hurt and now it's like I'm lost at sea
Try as I might I can't locate the coast
I'm left floating in my tears feeling like a freaking ghost

And yet somehow I've made a friend
And try as I might I can't play pretend
I care, he does too
The only problem? I can't seem to let him through
I love him, I really do
And know he loves me enough for two
Trust issues, but he's patient with me
Says he's here and always will be

I want to tell him what's in my head
But every time I try my tongue feels like lead
He wants to help; he helplessly keeps knocking on my door 
And when I don't open it, he sits down against it out on the floor
I deal with my pain in silence alone
Fight my demons and suffer the cyclones
He waits every storm out, he's always there
I hate how I can't let him in even though I am aware

This fort was built to keep people out
But it keeps me caged in too, without a doubt
I like to think I'm strong but I'm a coward all around
At the first sign of trouble, everything goes under lockdown

I hate vulnerability even with people I trust
And it hurts them in ways that I know are unjust
I've lately begun to realize that my silence hurts him now
And I wish it didn't, I wish I was strong enough to make it better somehow
I wish I was a better friend than I am
I wish being mine didn't feel like a constant exam
I wish I could let people in more easily
And save them the hurt of having to know me

I want to learn but I am at a loss
I'm unteachable and all the roads are crossed
I always take the wrong path and wound up lost
And every time my loved ones pay the cost
I think time is what I need
But it's a luxury and there are no guarantees
Six years from now I'll probably be the same
On the beck and call of my past every time it calls my name
And I say I'm over it but evidently I'm not
The wounds have healed but left nasty scars
He tells me it's okay, that it gets better with time
But what if I never get better and stay bitter like lime?

They're bound to get tired, of waiting for me to come around
I know I'm resilient but what if from this I never rebound?

It's a fear of mine that they'll leave one day 
Because waiting is hard and how long will they wait?
And even though it'll break me I'll have nothing to say
It kills me to know:
I'll have to watch them walk out cuz they realized I am dead weight.
