In the realm where haunted memories reside,
Your strength eclipses the ghosts by your side.
Their feeble whispers can't extinguish your flame,
For within you burns a resilient claim.
Your capacity to feel, a cherished trait,
I'll stand beside you, helping shackles abate.

Through the tempest of doubt, you find your way,
Pushing others aside, fearing they may stray.
But trust in my love, for it's unwavering and true,
I'll mend the wounds of abandonment, through and through.
Together, we'll fortify these walls of defense,
Replacing floods of hurt with a haven immense.
No longer lost, but embraced by love's host,
You're seen, cherished, never a spectral ghost.



In genuine moments, our friendship takes flight,
Your honesty shines, dispelling all masks so tight.
I'm grateful to witness your caring soul so clear,
Though walls remain, I'll patiently persevere.
Know that my love for you runs deep and true,
With trust as our guide, we'll conquer what's due.
Together, we'll navigate life's turbulent sea,
Bound eternally, till death sets us free.

In the depths of your thoughts, unspoken and unsaid,
Know that I sense the emotions that tread.
Silent conversations, they hold great power,
Transcending words in our shared hour.
I'll wait at your door, no matter how long it takes,
Ready to lend strength when your spirit aches.
Though you face the demons, storms raging within,
Together, we'll find solace, battling as kin.
No need for haste, I'll be here, steadfast and near,
Ready to offer support, erasing every fear.
Trust that in time, the door shall open wide,
For our bond's resilience, love's unyielding tide.

Your fortress shields, yet keeps you contained,
But I'm here to help shatter its chains.
You are strong, no need to be a lone ranger,
Let's face troubles together, unafraid of danger.
Transparency brings solace, trust in me,
Together, we'll break free and set your spirit free.

In embrace of vulnerability, you feel the weight,
But with trusted souls, it's safe to dissipate.
You doubt my trust, but I swear it's true,
I'll prove my loyalty, whatever you may do.
Your silence speaks volumes, I hear its call,
Strength resides within you, far more than us all
Letting others in is a challenge, I understand,
But your presence heals me, like none can withstand.
Banish the notion that knowing you brings pain,
For in my heart, your friendship is a cherished gain.

In this journey of learning, don't feel lost,
You're teachable, despite the paths that crossed.
Mistakes may be made, but together we'll find,
The right way forward, leaving no loved ones behind.
Time is a gift, one I'll gladly bestow,
For healing takes patience, as we both know.
Years from now, you'll bloom in your own light,
With strength and growth, breaking free from the night.
The past may beckon, but closure you'll find,
I'll stand by your side, heart and soul intertwined.
Even if bitterness lingers like lime's sour taste,
My love for you forever deepens, it will never be erased.

Those who tire of waiting aren't meant to stay,
Their love shallow, ready to fade away.
But I remain, steadfast by your side,
Believing in your abilities, always by your side

Your fear of abandonment, it tears at my heart,
But please know, from your side, I'll never depart.
You're not dead weight, for our bond is profound,
In this symphony of friendship, our souls are bound.
I'm here to stay, through the highs and the low,
Our connection, a masterpiece that continues to grow.
Never doubt your worth, for you shine so bright,
In this journey together, we'll conquer every plight.

In this dance of life, our steps intertwine,
With laughter as our rhythm, joy we'll define.
Through all the ups and downs, side by side we'll be,
A friendship's warmth, a smile on your face, I guarantee.
As days drift by, our bond ever swells,
A friendship cherished, where radiant love dwells.
