Glitch tokens are pieces of words or **tokens** in **GPT** that cause the system to glitch out and give crazy outputs.

Basically, the reason that these tokens glitch [[GPT]] is because they were random stuff in the training which did get assigned a point in the [[LLM]] vector space but didn't come up in training enough.
So the model build a kind of intuition or guess for these words
Some of them are:
- "?????-?????-"
- PsyNetMessage
- SolidGoldMagikarp
-  RandomRedditorWithNo

These are mostly [[Reddit]] Usernames or just random stuff. Like PsyNetMessage is a log message title from Rocket League short for Psyonics Network Message
