Her Paragraph:
I am so haunted by the ghosts of my past
Sabotaging everything I have so it never lasts
Letting my fears get the better of me
Shackled my bonds so that I can't break free
I say I'm stone but I feel more than I should
I would really turn off the switch if I could

What I want to say:
The ghosts of the past are very weak in front of your strength, and I am sure you can overcome them. Its not bad that you feel a lot, its my favourite thing about you. I would do anything to help you break those shackles.

Tone:
Kind, Loving, Concerned, Assuring

Her Paragraph:
Pushing people away, never letting them close
Then feeling my heart ache cause I feel more alone than most
Loving them from a distance and loving them with all my heart
But I know how to leave them before they leave me like an artist knows his art
Built these walls around me because I thought they'd protect me
But the walls are flooded with my hurt and now it's like I'm lost at sea
Try as I might I can't locate the coast
I'm left floating in my tears feeling like a freaking ghost

What I want to say:
Pushing away was one of my bad traits too, but you need to understand you can trust me. I know how much you love me, and I want to love you the same. I'm hurt u think I would leave you ever. I know those walls were for your sake, and now I will help you clean the flood and build a castle. I'm so sorry you feel like you are a ghost.

Tone:
Kind, Loving, Concerned, Assuring

Her Paragraph:
And yet somehow I've made a friend
And try as I might I can't play pretend
I care, he does too
The only problem? I can't seem to let him through
I love him, I really do
And know he loves me enough for two
Trust issues, but he's patient with me
Says he's here and always will be

What I want to say:
I'm flattered and happy that you can't pretend with me. It gives me a way to know how u are doing. I hope u find a way to let me through. I know u love me, I really do. I understand the trust issues and yeah I'm here till death do us apart

Tone/Mood:
Assuring, Loving

Her Paragraph:
I want to tell him what's in my head
But every time I try my tongue feels like lead
He wants to help; he helplessly keeps knocking on my door 
And when I don't open it, he sits down against it out on the floor
I deal with my pain in silence alone
Fight my demons and suffer the cyclones
He waits every storm out, he's always there
I hate how I can't let him in even though I am aware

What I want to say:
You don't have to tell me and put everything in words, I feel your feelings. Some conversations speak more than the words. I will always patiently wait for you to open the door and let me in. If you need help, I am ready with full force. I hate that you deal with it all alone, I would fight your demons but you have to do it, all I can do is help. I hope you find a way to let me in.

Tone/Mood:
Reassuring, Loving, Confident, Kind

Her Paragraph:
This fort was built to keep people out
But it keeps me caged in too, without a doubt
I like to think I'm strong but I'm a coward all around
At the first sign of trouble, everything goes under lockdown

What I want to say:
I am so concerned about you not being able to get out of the cage that some days I feel like cutting the (metaphorical) cage. You are strong (emphasis on are) for nobody has the strength to deal with all this alone. I have no problem with a lockdown, but I want to make sure you don't hide things from me, which I know is hard, but i reassure you it will feel better.

Tone/Mood:
Loving, Concerned, Empowering, Kind

Her Paragraph:
I hate vulnerability even with people I trust
And it hurts them in ways that I know are unjust
I've lately begun to realize that my silence hurts him now
And I wish it didn't, I wish I was strong enough to make it better somehow
I wish I was a better friend than I am
I wish being mine didn't feel like a constant exam
I wish I could let people in more easily
And save them the hurt of having to know me

What I want to say:
You hating vulnerability in people you trust is something I get, but trust me, with people you trust, its okay to be vulnerable. Maybe its me not being trust worthy enough. You can tell me if I can do something to make u feel so. I don't know what to say, all I know is I have the patience and your silence still speaks volumes. I have said it before and will say it again, you are stronger than anyone I know. the best friend I can have, letting people in is not easy when one has gone through what you have. You have made excellent progress. And dont u dare think that it hurts me knowing you, if anything it has healed me.

Tone/Mood:
Immense Love, Kind, Fierce Love, Assurance, A little anger in the last line

Her Paragraph:

I want to learn but I am at a loss
I'm unteachable and all the roads are crossed
I always take the wrong path and wound up lost
And every time my loved ones pay the cost
I think time is what I need
But it's a luxury and there are no guarantees
Six years from now I'll probably be the same
On the beck and call of my past every time it calls my name
And I say I'm over it but evidently I'm not
The wounds have healed but left nasty scars
He tells me it's okay, that it gets better with time
But what if I never get better and stay bitter like lime?

What I want to say:
You aren't unteachable, you can totally do this, though I understand if its hard. As someone who loves you, I am okay with the wrong paths, because I am here to correct and help you. Time is something I can give u a lot, because I know this kind of stuff takes time. I dont think u will be the same years from now because u have become so much more in the past two. The past is naughty, it will call you, but you need full closure. If u stay bitter like lime, I will still love you the same, even more i think.

Tone/Mood: 
Assuring, Loving, Caring, Kind, Making her feel I am here forever

Her Paragraph: 
They're bound to get tired, of waiting for me to come around
I know I'm resilient but what if from this I never rebound?

What I want to say:
People who get tired arent here to show you love, just here to take it from u, even if it means giving some. But I am here with love which is  unconditional. And I trust you to rebound and fix urself, and even if you don't you are perfect as you already are.

Tone/Mood:
Angry at people who left, Lighthearted, Loving, Kind, Reassuring

Her Paragraph: 
It's a fear of mine that they'll leave one day 
Because waiting is hard and how long will they wait?
And even though it'll break me I'll have nothing to say
It kills me to know:
I'll have to watch them walk out cuz they realized I am dead weight.

What I want to say:
I don't know how and who told you I will leave. Because you are an integral part of my life. Donot be afraid of me leaving, and to be honest I also feel like I am not a good enough friend, that one day you will wake up and feel like you don't need me anymore. its not like we are all perfect individuals, but together, we create a painting so beautiful, that even the gods bow down to acknowledge our friendship

Tone/Mood:
Really Hurt, Loving, Assuring
