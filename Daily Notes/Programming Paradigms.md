## 1. Imperative Programming:
- One of the oldest programming paradigm. 
- Features close relation to machine architecture.
- Based on the [Von Neumann](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-von-neumann-architecture/) architecture.
- It works by changing the program states through assignment statements.
- It performs step by step task by changing state.
- The main focus is on how to achieve a goal.
- The result after execution of all statements is stored.

### Advantages:
- Very Simple to implement
- Contains variables, loops etc.

### Disadvantages:
- Solving complex problems is not possible.
- Less efficient and 

## Object Oriented Programming


## Functional Programming
