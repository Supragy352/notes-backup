OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an [[open-source]] [[computer vision]] and [[machine learning]] [[software library]]. It is a [[cross-platform]] library, which means it can be used on various operating systems like [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[MacOS]]. OpenCV was first released in 1999 and has since become one of the most widely used libraries in [[computer vision]].

OpenCV provides a wide range of functionalities for [[image and video processing]]. It includes various [[algorithms]] and techniques for [[image processing]], [[object detection]], [[object recognition]], and [[machine learning]]. Some of the key features of OpenCV are:

1. **Image and Video Processing:** OpenCV provides a wide range of functions for image and video processing, including [[filtering]], [[thresholding]], [[morphological operations]], [[color space conversions]], and [[geometric transformations]]. These functions can be used to enhance the quality of images, remove noise, detect edges, and perform various other operations on images and videos.
2. **Object Detection and Recognition:** OpenCV includes various [[algorithms]] and techniques for object detection and recognition, such as [[Haar cascades]], [[HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients),]] and [[Deep Learning]]-based approaches like [[YOLO (You Only Look Once)]] and [[SSD (Single Shot Detector)]]. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize objects in real-time.
3. **Machine Learning:** OpenCV provides a wide range of machine learning [[algorithms]] for [[classification]], [[clustering]], and [[regression]]. It includes various popular machine learning algorithms like [[SVM (Support Vector Machines)]], [[Random Forests]], and [[Neural Networks]].
5. **Camera Calibration:** OpenCV includes [[functions]] for [[camera calibration]], which is an essential step in computer vision applications that involve [[3D reconstruction]] or [[object tracking]]. Camera calibration helps to remove distortion from images and obtain accurate measurements.

OpenCV is written in [[C++]], but it also provides interfaces for other [[programming languages]] like [[Computer Science/Languages/Python]], [[Java]], and [[MATLAB]]. OpenCV is distributed under the [[BSD license]], which allows users to use and modify the code without any restrictions. This makes OpenCV an ideal choice for both academic and commercial projects.

In summary, OpenCV is a powerful and versatile library for [[computer vision]] and [[machine learning]]. It provides a wide range of functions for [[image and video processing]], [[object detection]] and [[Object Recognition|recognition]], [[machine learning]], and [[camera calibration]]. Its [[open-source]] nature and [[cross-platform support]] make it a popular choice among researchers, developers, and hobbyists alike.
