# Definition and Explainations:
- A **physics engine** is computer software that provides an approximate simulation of certain physical systems, such as **rigid body dynamics** (including collision detection), **soft body dynamics**, and **fluid dynamics**, of use in the domains of computer graphics, video games and film (CGI). 
- Their main uses are in video games (typically as middleware), in which case the simulations are in real-time.
- The term is sometimes used more generally to describe any software system for simulating physical phenomena, such as high-performance scientific simulation.
