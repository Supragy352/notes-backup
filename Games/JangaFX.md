# A Brief History of JangaFX

JangaFX was founded in 2016 by Nick Seavert, an entrepreneur well-versed in real-time VFX technologies. Rather than accepting outside investment to fund the company, Nick initially bootstrapped JangaFX through credit cards, software sales, and sweat equity. JangaFX's first tool, [[VectorayGen]], was released in 2017, and our flagship product, [[EmberGen]], in 2019. [[EmberGen]] is a standalone real-time volumetric fluid simulation tool ideal for generating flipbooks, image sequences, and VDB files.  
  
Our mission is to provide cutting-edge real-time VFX tools to artists and designers within the video game and film industries. Most workflows for real-time VFX production in games rely on software packages suited toward the film and CG industries. Weâ€™re working hard to change this sad state of affairs by providing tools specifically built for game developers' unique needs. If you happen to be in the film or pre-viz industry, don't worry: we've got great tools for you too and we are actively developing new tools for film and motion graphics! We support exports to common industry formats, such as VDB and EXR.
