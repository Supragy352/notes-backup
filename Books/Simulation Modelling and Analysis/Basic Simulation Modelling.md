# Basic Simulation Modelling

## 1.1 Nature of Simulation

**System:** The facility or process of interest.

**Model:** To simulate these systems we need to make some assumptions, mathematical or logical. These assumptions/ set of rules constitute a model.

**Analytical Method**: If the rules are simple, using math to get the exact result is called an Analytical Method. Real-world models are too big to be mathematically and analytically evaluated, hence we have Simulations.
